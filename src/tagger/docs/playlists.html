This document is a survey of playlist data formats.  It is useful in
two ways.  One, as a collation of data which is normally scattered all
over the web, it is a helpful reference.  Two, having this data in
one place makes it easier to observe patterns.<p/>

Playlists are comparatively simple objects.  They are nothing but
lists -- here is the first song, here is the second.  As a result they
fail to excite the imagination of many people, because the expressive
possibilities seem too limited.  But from my background as a musician,
arranger and composer, I know that the sequencing of aesthetic
experiences has huge expressive possibilities.  In my work on
playlists I aim to help extend the expressive power of sequencing to
objects on the world wide web.<p/>

<h2>Administrative Notes</h2><p/>

Because I wanted the broadest possible view of the needs and abilities
of applications that use playlists, I have attempted to make this
listing exhaustive.  As a result there are several hopelessly obscure
entries, including one for which there is no real world implementation
and one for which there is only a single instance in the real
world.<p/>

This is an informal draft aimed at the community of people interested
in playlists.  Comments are welcome.  I would be particularly grateful
for corrections.<p/>

<h2>Observed Patterns</h2><p/>

In this section I will comment on patterns observed among the
different formats.  This section precedes the facts on which it is
based, so you may want to skip over to the reference before coming
back here.  I put it first because the reference section is dull
stuff, not intended for browsing, and I doubt that any reader will
discover this section if it is after the reference.<p/>

There are both syntactic and semantic differences.  Syntactic
differences include things like binary versus text formats, the number
of dimensions a format can encompass, and so on.  Semantic difference
express application requirements, for example the issue of whether
metadata about contained objects should be in the container or the
object; this is an application requirement because its utility depends
on the level of trust in the metadata, which varies from one usecase
to another.<p/>

<ul>

<li><i>Dimensionality</i>: I have observed three levels of
dimensionality in playlist formats.  Flat files, which are the most
popular, are one dimensional.  INI files, which are based on a feature
of the Windows API, are two dimensional.  XML files support an
arbitrary number of features, so are N-dimensional.<p/></li>

<li><i>Mime types</i>:  Mime types for playlist formats tend to be
ad-hoc rather than formal; most have improvised names like
application/x-something or text/fooCorp-barApp.  There is a dedicated
mime type for every playlist format.  (Except for DAAP, which is
intermingled with other data.)  <p/></li>

<li><i>Originators</i>:  Few playlist formats are formally specified.
Most are proprietary formats defined for compatibility with specific
applications.  One is an ad-hoc standard in the public domain with no
specification or owner, and one is a standard of the W3C.<p/></li>

<li><i>Metadata</i>:  Some playlist formats support metadata about
contained objects, some don't.  The dividing line is typically whether
the data format supports more than one dimension.  All of the XML
formats support some form of metadata, but none use the Dublin
Core standard.<p/></li>

<li><i>Dependencies on referenced resources</i>:

A number of formats are syntactically so similar that they can only be
distinguished by the type of object they can reference.  The RAM
format, for example, is barely different from M3U, except that it can
reference proprietary file types belonging to Real, which also owns
the RAM format. <p/>

</li>

<li><i>Resource locations</i>: Some formats expect resources to be remote URLs, some expect resources to be local files on the client, many allow remote resources grudgingly.  iTunes, for example, will only play the first URL in an M3U file.<p/></li>

<li><i>Application-defined catalogs versus shareable publications</i>: Design choices were usually made to satisfy the needs of a media-rendering application.  Most playlist formats are catalogs of files stored on the client, with the ability to reference remote resources added as an afterthought if at all.  As a result, these formats have as much in common with configuration files as they do with publication formats like HTML.<p/></li>

<li><i>Complexity vs. simplicity</i>:  There is wide divergence in the level of complexity.  The most popular format, M3U, is also the simplest.  In contrast, there is a noticeable scarcity of agents capable of using SMIL, which is one of the most complex formats.<p/></li>

<li><i>Text rather than binary</i>:  Out of all the following formats, only DAAP is binary.  But the binary nature of DAAP is only syntactic sugar, since it is semantically identical to the textual XML format used by the iTunes library.<p/></li>

<li><i>Orthogonal functions</i>: Playlist functionality encompasses audio metadata like the name of the artist; sequence information about the order and presence of songs; and presentation information like the background color of the player.  Some formats mix these together, some keep them strictly separate.  M3U specifies only the sequence, SMIL specifies only sequence and presentation, and MusicBrainz specifies only sequence and metadata.<p/></li>

</ul>

<tr colspan="3"><td><a name="M3U"/><h3>M3U</h3></td></tr>
<tr>
	<td align="right" valign="top"><em>Description:</em></td>
	<td align="left" valign="top">Every line in an M3U file is either a comment, a blank, or a resource to render.  A comment line begins with the pound sign, #.  Blanks are ignored.  A resource is the address of a media file.<p/>

A resource address can be anything the M3U reader is capable of understanding.  These include absolute filesystem paths, relative filesystem paths (with the base undefined by the file format), and URLs.<p/>

A resource can be anything the M3U reader is capable of rendering.  To my knowledge these are always audio files, but there is no set reason for that to be true.  However, it may not be wise to point to proprietary media formats like Real streaming audio in an M3U file, since many players will throw a user-visible error for media they cannot render.<p/>

The design philosophy of M3U is to let resource data types do the work.  Players that don't understand an address or resource type usually skip the entry.  The ability to reference URLs, in addition to filesystem paths, was added this way; some players (Winamp and XMMS, notably) simply added the ability to handle URLs to their M3U readers.<p/>

Support for M3U features varies wildly.  iTunes, for example, will only render the first entry in an M3U file.<p/>

M3U is by far the most popular playlist format, probably due to its simplicity.  It is an ad-hoc standard with no formal definition, no canonical source, and no owner.<p/>

	<td align="left" valign="top">Before ID3 tags were widely supported by MP3 players, a flavor of M3U called Extended M3U was used to indicate audio metadata.  Extended M3U is now obsolete.  The following description of Extended M3U is copied in verbatim from Google's cache of the reverse-engineered documentation at http://hanna.pyxidis.org/tech/m3u.html, which is now a defunct URL.<p/>

<blockquote>
<pre>
#EXTM3U
#EXTINF:111,3rd Bass - Al z A-B-Cee z
mp3/3rd Bass/3rd bass - Al z A-B-Cee z.mp3
#EXTINF:462,Apoptygma Berzerk - Kathy«s song (VNV Nation rmx)
mp3/Apoptygma Berzerk/Apoptygma Berzerk - Kathy's Song (Victoria Mix by VNV Nation).mp3
#EXTINF:394,Apoptygma Berzerk - Kathy's Song

</pre>

</p>
<p><i>The First line, "#EXTM3U" is the format descriptor, in this case  M3U (or Extended  M3U as it can be called).  It does not change, it's always this.</i>
</p>
<p><i>The second and third operate in a pair.  The second begins "#EXTINF:" which serves as the record marker.  The "#EXTINF" is unchanging.  After the colon is a number: this number is the length of the track in whole seconds (not minutes:seconds or anything else. Then comes a comma and the name of the tune (not the FILE NAME).  A good list generator will suck this data from the ID3 tag if there is one, and if not it will take the file name with the extension chopped off.</i>
<p><i>The second line of this pair (the third line) is the actual file name of the media in question.  In my example they aren't fully qualified because I run this list by typing "noatun foo.m3u" in my home directory and my music is in ~/mp3, so it just follows the paths as relative from the path of invocation.</i>

The ASX family of formats are somewhat a moving target, however, since they are defined by implementation in the windows Media Player and related APIs, which is changing rapidly at this time.  I suspect but haven't confirmed that just about any kind of media can be pointed to within a playlist as long as the playlist is correctly handed off from the browser to Windows Media Player.<p/>

<tr>
	<td align="right" valign="top"><em>Description:</em></td>
	<td align="left" valign="top">MAGMA is a manifest format proposed informally by Gordon Mohr on the Magnet-URI mailing list.  The purpose is to allow Magnet URI types to be used in playlists.  Like KPL, these would allow files to be identified by hash.  Like M3U and RAM, these would be one-dimensional.  Like the ASX family and RAM, the MAGMA format would be used to flag the need for a special handler.<p/>

MAGMA makes two improvements to M3U syntax.  First, the header line contains a magic number (the "MAGMA" string) to identify the file type, as well as a URI to identify the web source of the file.  Second, an entry can span multiple lines if trailing parts begin with whitespace.<p/>

	<td align="left" valign="top">A RAM file is a flat file containing a list of media URLs, with one URL per line.  It is almost identical to an M3U playlist, except that it may contain URLs of proprietary RealAudio media types, and URLs can be tweaked to affect the Real player startup mode.  <p/>

Notice that this difference between M3U and RAM is similar to the way that Microsoft playlist formats like ASX, WMV and WAX have the same syntax but are constrained to point towards different kinds of remote resources.<p/>

Startup mode of the Real client can be specified by adding a query string after the resource.  RAM embeds parameters for the local player in URLs of remote resources; this practice can be described as bizarre.<p/>

RAM is a loosely defined proprietary format whose purpose can be summed up as launching one of the various Real clients and having it figure out what to do.<p/>

Metadata in RAM files is appended to URIs.<p/>

If the URI in the RAM file points
to a RealMedia file (i.e. not an MP3, etc.) you
can overwrite the title, author, copyright and
abstract information in the RealPlayer by adding
parameters with these four names (all in lower
case) at the end of the line, separated by a ?
for the first parameter, and &'s for the rest.  For example:<p/>

<pre>pnm://server.address.here:1234/realmedia.rm
 ?title=My Song
 &author=My Artist
 &copyright=2004 My Company
 &abstract=Under the (i) button!</pre>

(This should all be one line, without spaces).<p/>

It's not necessary to use all these parameters.
Simply adding ?abstract=Info after the filename
leaves title, author and copyright unchanged,
and only adds "Abstract: Info" in the player's
Clip information window.<p/>

It happens that when the syntax and semantics of this template are applied to an collection of audio works, the result is indistinguishable from a playlist.  As an example, Mike Linksvayer of Creative Commons used an XSLT stylesheet to create a SMIL playlist from the embedded license RDF in the web page for the Creative Commons CD release "Copy Me Remix Me" at <a href="http://creativecommons.org/extras/copyremix">http://creativecommons.org/extras/copyremix</a>.

MusicBrainz is a project to compile high quality audio metadata.  The
MusicBrainz metadata format is not strictly a playlist format at all,
but rather a format to describe audio resources which happens to
encompass collections of audio resources as well.  In that context the
collections that it describes are termed <i>albums</i>,
where <i>album</i> is a shorthand for a set of audio resources
released together on hard media like CDs, records, or cassettes.
